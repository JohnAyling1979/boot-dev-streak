# boot-dev-streak

A simple repository to keep the Boot.dev streak active while temporarily unable to submit solutions in guest mode.

This repo helps maintain activity tracking when you're temporarily in guest mode on Boot.dev, where the ability to submit solutions is restricted.

## Why?

Boot.dev's streak feature is a great motivational tool, but guest mode restricts the ability to submit solutions once you hit a certain point. This makes it impossible to maintain your streak since you can't complete exercises. This repo provides a way to bridge that gap during temporary guest mode usage.

I've made this public so anyone can submit any code they want to this repo. Just keep it clean, don't break other people's code and don't commit any private information.

## Usage

1. Use this while temporarily in guest mode
2. Return to regular account access to resume normal solution submissions
3. This helps prevent breaking your streak during brief periods where you can't submit solutions

Note: This is intended as a temporary solution only while dealing with guest mode restrictions, not as a permanent alternative to actually completing exercises.

Quick commit at EOD to keep the streak.
